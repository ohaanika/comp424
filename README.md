Tablut, a Finnish variant of the classic Viking game Hnefatafl is a two-player perfect deterministic game. To accomplish the objective of winning Tablut, the following two game playing strategies were explored:
</br> 
</br> (1) Alpha-Beta pruning
</br> (2) Monte Carlo Tree Search
</br> 
</br> Ultimately, since the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm performed better than Monte Carlo Tree Search, this algorithm as submitted for the COMP 424 class tournament. This programme ranked 21st among ~270 students.
</br> 
</br> The clockworks of the game were created by Kian Kenyon-Dean (COMP 424 Teacher Assistant). The game playing strategies within the folder "/src/student_player" were created by me.
